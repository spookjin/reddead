# Red Dead 2 Lite

This repository contains a small Python game inspired by **Red Dead Redemption 2**. It uses the `pygame` library to create a simple top-down world where you can move your character and ride a horse.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org)

Install the dependency using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running

Execute the game with:

```bash
python game.py
```

## Controls

* **Arrow keys** &ndash; move the player
* **H** &ndash; mount or dismount the horse when standing next to it

This demo is a toy example and does not attempt to replicate the full scope of Red Dead Redemption 2. It is meant purely for educational purposes.
